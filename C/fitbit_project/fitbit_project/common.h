   The choice was obvious for me use a heap for the max 32 values and a queue for the last 32.
   I had a lot of fun implimenting these as there are a lot of little optimizations that can be done. 
   The choice of 32 samples to track I'm sure was no accident ;)

/*The struct is to allow the bit field. The idea is to reduce memory usage by 1/4, but at least my compiler is not
  cooperating. The issue is accessing the odd indexes are rather innefficent so it decied to add padding in the array...
  The only real way to do this would be to roll it manually. I could (and I have a though on how to do it fairly 
  efficiently) but we are talking about a combined 32 bytes here betwen the heap and queue. There is a high probability
  the added overhead to do the more complex accessing would outway any savings.
